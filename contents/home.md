Currently, in the final year of research for a PhD in Complexity and Computational Social Science at Sorbonne Université. I am also associated with teams at Sciences Po’s médialab and LPI Cité Université in Paris. My thesis focuses on extending opinion dynamics models to: (1) consider group identification (key to affective polarization), and (2) to be able to handle large online datasets (via mean-field approximation).

Before my current research, I spent several years as an Editorial Analyst at The Guardian, and as a Financial Consultant in both London and Madrid. My academic background before that was Mathematics and Engineering.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.

#### Education
PhD, Computer Science, Sorbonne Université, France, 2022-ongoing.\
MEng, Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, UK, 2017—2018.\
MEng, Engineering Mathematics (Exchange Year), EPFL, Switzerland, 2016—2017.\
Undergraduate Engineering School, University of Bristol, UK, 2014-16.

#### Research Interests
The intersection of complex networks, mathematical modeling, artificial intelligence, and media. I am particularly focused on investigating questions relating to political polarization within social platforms, the influence of group identity, and modelling methods for large datasets. By leveraging interdisciplinary approaches, I develop research into the dynamics and mechanisms that contribute to the creation and fragmentation of online communities.
