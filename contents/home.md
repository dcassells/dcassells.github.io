I am currently pursuing a PhD in Complexity and Computational Social Science at Sorbonne Université. I am also associated with teams at Sciences Po’s médialab and LPI Cité Université in Paris.

Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol is where my academic journey began - completing both my master’s and undergraduate degrees there. During these studies, I spent a year in the Mathematics and Computer Science departments at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), focusing on stochastic processes, complex networks, and artificial intelligence.

Following my master’s, I had the privilege of working as a senior data analyst for the Guardian, in London, informing editorial strategies and contributing to the development of innovative products. Before my time there, I also held a position as a financial data consultant, collaborating with institutions in both London and Madrid.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.

#### Education
PhD, Computer Science, Sorbonne Université, France, 2022-ongoing.\
MEng, Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, UK, 2017—2018.\
MEng, Engineering Mathematics (Exchange Year), EPFL, Switzerland, 2016—2017.\
Undergraduate Engineering School, University of Bristol, UK, 2014-16.

#### Research Interests
The intersection of network science, mathematical modeling, and media. I am particularly focused on investigating questions related to political polarization within social platforms, and the influence of group identity. By leveraging interdisciplinary approaches, I develop research into the dynamics and mechanisms that contribute to the creation and fragmentation of online communities.
